# CMCB in Rust

*computational modeling of cognition and behavior* example codes, implemented with Rust (initially R).

Use rust toolchain (argmin, CmdStan, ndarray, etc.) and skip some simple codes.

code lies in src/bin, run with `cargo run --bin [file_name]`

## Why Choosing Rust?

I choose Rust for several reasons:

1. Rust is a programming language similar to C++, making it easy for me to transition without much effort. Additionally, it incorporates functional programming concepts, which I find quite appealing.
2. Writing Rust is enjoyable. The language attracts programming language scholars and myself in the same reason.
3. Rust offers an environment that helps manage program complexity. While the initial coding difficulty may be high, as the codebase grows, it doesn't become excessively complicated.
4. Many errors can be detected during compilation.

## TODO List

- [ ] Get to use CmdStan in rust.
- [ ] Reproduct of cmcb 8.2&8.3.
- [ ] Find a new plotting crates or build up an easy way to plot.
